# Purpose
An application that helps simplify the task rate tracking system for Data Analysts at TELUS International.  

This application aims to resolve:
* Waiting 24 hours to check task count on the Geoworkerz portal.
* Better management of ERT (estimated rating time).

# Key Features
* Different menus for every task type
* A timer to help maintain ERT.
* Earnings amount is always saved (even when the application is closed) to a database file, but the user can always clear it.
