# Purpose
A project to help out fellow Data Analysts working under TELUS International. This program counts the amount of earnings per question type and saves the question total unless user clears their data. Unfortunately, this program is useless to DAs that aren't in the United States, but I'm planning to make a version that accounts for different locales.
