# Purpose
A project to help out fellow Data Analysts working under TELUS International. This program counts the amount of earnings per question type and saves the question total unless user clears their data. 

# Disclaimer 
This program is only useful to US Data Analysts on Windows at the moment, but there are plans for different locales and more OS support in the near future.
